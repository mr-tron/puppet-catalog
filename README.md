puppet-catalog
==============

Puppet module for export and import variable between hosts

worked only with puppetdb (api v3)

Thi module is more simple than https://github.com/alvagante/puppet-exported_vars becouse you don`t need run puppet on PuppetMaster and you can create more flexible variables lists.

Read files in "tests/" directory for manuals.
